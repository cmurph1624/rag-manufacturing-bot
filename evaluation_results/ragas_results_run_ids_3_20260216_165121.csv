However, a separate section on Charging Safety states:

● Do not charge if the ambient temperature is above 40°C (104°F).

This implies that the maximum ambient temperature allowed for charging batteries should ideally be below 40°C (104°F) to ensure safe and reliable charging.

However, I can suggest that it's likely a screwdriver with an M3 tip, as M3x10 screws are commonly driven by M3 socket wrenches or Allen wrenches.

According to SOP-01 | Rev: 2.4 (Page 1), the procedure mentions using four M3x10 screws and applying Loctite 243 to the threads of each screw.
