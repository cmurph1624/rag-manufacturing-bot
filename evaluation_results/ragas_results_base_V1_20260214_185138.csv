However, if calibration doesn't work, and you're getting an IMU Calibration Fail error, it's recommended to try flying the drone away from metal structures or objects that may be causing magnetic interference, then switch back to GPS mode.

This might not resolve the issue immediately. In this case:

1. Check your propellers for damage.
2. Replace all propellers regardless of their condition.

Note: If calibrating and replacing propellers don't solve the problem, you can look into other possible solutions or consult the manual or technical documentation for additional guidance.

Additionally, using an anti-fog insert specifically designed for the X1 camera could also be a solution, as mentioned by Water_Boy.
