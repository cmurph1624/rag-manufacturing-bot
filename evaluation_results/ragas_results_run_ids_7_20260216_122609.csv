However, there is an option in the ""Connect the drone to the PC using a USB-C cable"" step that may be related. The instructions state: 

""Hold the power button for 5 seconds until the drone beeps three times.""

While this instruction is not directly about entering DFU mode, it does indicate how to initiate the update process on the drone.
