According to SOP-01_Rotor_Arm_Assembly_Falcon_X1.pdf, I couldn't find any information about a solid red LED pattern indicating something specific on the Falcon X1.

However, after re-examining the provided context, I found that the Slack Thread mentioned the following:

 Solid Red LEDs indicate an **ERROR**

- The 'Error' is in green
Solid red indicates an error""
