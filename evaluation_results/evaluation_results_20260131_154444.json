                "Q: Help! My Falcon Pro is only getting like 500m range before the signal drops. Box says 5km.\n A: Pilot_Dave: Send it back, sounds like a dud unit.\n A: Tech_Guru: @Pilot_Dave hold on. @OP, how are you holding the controller?\n A: OP_Flyer: Just normal, pointing the antennas right at the drone.\n A: Tech_Guru: That is your problem. This is a common mistake. Dipole antennas radiate from the sides, not the tip. You need to orient the antennas perpendicular to the drone (broadside), not point the tips at it.\n A: OP_Flyer: Wow, just tried that and signal went to 100%. Thanks!",
