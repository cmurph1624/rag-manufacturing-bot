        "Q: Has anyone seen the Falcon X1 shake violently when descending quickly? It looks like a death wobble.\n A: Pilot_Tom: Sounds like your PID gains are too high. Try lowering the 'P' gain on the vertical axis.\n A: X1_Vet: @Pilot_Tom No, don't touch the gains! That's a classic mistake on the X1.\n A: X1_Vet: @OP, what is the temperature outside? If it's below 5\u00b0C, check your rubber gimbal dampeners.\n A: OP_Flyer: Yeah it's freezing today, about 2\u00b0C.\n A: X1_Vet: That's it. The rubber stiffens up in the cold and causes that oscillation. Warm them up in your hands for a minute before you fly, it will stop the shake.\n A: OP_Flyer: Wow, that worked instantly. Thanks."
